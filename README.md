Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  //DriverPass was a company seeking to fill an open niche in the market where driving students did not have many options as to online learning sources with practice tests that also included driving instructions. They wanted an online system that would allow students to choose a package and schedule driving lessons, read learning materials pulled straight form the DMV and be able to take practice tests before taking their real driving test.

What did you do particularly well?
  
  //I think I did the non-technical overview quite well and I did like the UML diagrams I created. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  //While I liked the UML diagrams I made I think I could have done better with them if I gave myself more time to concentrate on them. Visual aids help so much in any presentation. I could better explain the diagrams or make them more thorough and follow more use-case paths.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  //If the user pays you to design something, they do expect their needs to be taken into account. Otherwise, why are they paying you? They need to be satisfied with what you built and actually want to use your solution. The user's needs included some flexibility (in enabling/disabling packages with an eye for creating more in the future) and in convenience (downloadable schedules, a customer able to reset their own password or seek the aid of a DriverPass employee, etc). I included these items in my diagrams and in my writing where I could.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  
  //I like to sit down and outline expectations and requirements, and then I like to chase all the avenues I can see down. A software requirement meeting is never short in my experience, and I like to outline edge cases when I think of them. I believe visual aids in the flows or use-cases would help me in my current role with my company. I currently build mock-UI's to lead meetings through use cases and scenarios.
